## ‚ú® Highlights

* To the best of our knowledge, AlphaDrive is the first to integrate GRPO-based RL with planning reasoning to autonomous driving, significantly boosting both performance and training efficiency.

* We are excited to discover that, following RL training, AlphaDrive exhibits some emergent multimodal planning capabilities, which is promising for improving driving safety and efficiency.


## üìã News

`[2025-3-26]:` We have released the training and evaluation scripts of AlphaDrive.

`[2025-3-11]:` AlphaDrive [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07608) paper released. Code are coming soon. Please stay tuned! ‚òïÔ∏è


## üéÆ Getting Started
### Installtion
```shell
git clone git@github.com:hustvl/AlphaDrive.git
conda create -n alphadrive python=3.11 -y
conda activate alphadrive
sh setup.sh
```

### Data Preparation
We provide the [prompt templates](https://github.com/hustvl/AlphaDrive/blob/main/data_tools/prompt_hub.py) used in AlphaDrive for training and generating planning reasoning data, and an example QA is provided in [example.json](https://github.com/hustvl/AlphaDrive/blob/main/data_tools/example.json).


### Training
For Supervised Fine-tuning Phase:
```shell
sh train_tools/run_train_sft.sh
```

For Reinforcement Learning Phase:
```shell
sh train_tools/run_train_grpo.sh
```

### Evaluation
You can evaluate the meta-action planning accuracy using the script below.
```shell
sh eval_tools/qwen2vl_plan_cmd_eval.sh
```
