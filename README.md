## ✨ Highlights

* To the best of our knowledge, AlphaDrive is the first to integrate GRPO-based RL with planning reasoning to autonomous driving, significantly boosting both performance and training efficiency.

* We are excited to discover that, following RL training, AlphaDrive exhibits some emergent multimodal planning capabilities, which is promising for improving driving safety and efficiency.
